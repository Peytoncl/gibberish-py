# About

This python file has some simple functions that will turn english into a bunch of random symbols and make it look kinda funny

# Usage

Put the python file into your project directory, then put this into your code

```py
from gibberish import *
```

# Example

If you want it to turn into symbols and text everywhere, use this example

```py
from gibberish import *

print(Gibberish("Hello World")
```

If you want to have JUST english with symbols all over it, use this

```py
from gibberish import *

print(Glitch("Hello World")
```

Last, you can just turn it into symbols (aka minecraft enchantment table letters)

```py
from gibberish import *

print(Galactic("Hello World")
```

# Requirements

There really are no requirements beside installing zalgo

```
pip install zalgo_text
```
